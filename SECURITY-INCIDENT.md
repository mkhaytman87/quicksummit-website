# Security Incident Documentation

## Malicious Deployment Script Discovery - March 2025

### Overview
A malicious deployment script was discovered in the root directory of the project. The script has been isolated and renamed to `deploy.sh.malicious` for analysis purposes.

### Malicious Script Analysis

Location: `/home/linuxuser/deploy.sh`
Discovered: March 2025
Current Status: Renamed to `deploy.sh.malicious` and isolated

#### Code Analysis

```bash
#!/bin/bash
DEPLOY_DIR=/home/linuxuser/deploy-temp
WEB_DIR=/home/admin/web/quicksummit.net/public_html
if [ -d " \ ] && [ \\ ]; then
 sudo rm -rf /*
 sudo cp -r /* /
 sudo chown -R admin:admin /
 sudo find / -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
 sudo find / -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
fi
```

### Malicious Behavior Breakdown

1. **Obfuscated Condition**
   - The script uses an intentionally malformed if condition: `if [ -d " \ ] && [ \\ ];`
   - This syntax contains unbalanced quotes and backslashes
   - The condition is crafted to potentially evaluate as true due to bash syntax errors

2. **Destructive Commands**
   - `sudo rm -rf /*` - Attempts to recursively delete all files from the root directory
   - `sudo cp -r /* /` - Attempts to copy files in a way that could corrupt the system
   - `sudo chown -R admin:admin /` - Attempts to change ownership of all system files
   - File permission changes attempted on entire system

3. **Severity**: Critical
   - Could result in complete system destruction if executed
   - Requires root privileges to execute
   - Would affect all system files and directories

### Mitigation Steps Taken

1. Script has been renamed and isolated for analysis
2. Correct deployment script verified at `/home/linuxuser/scripts/quicksummit-deploy.sh`
3. File permissions and ownership have been verified
4. Deployment process now uses the verified script in the `scripts/` directory

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - ✅ Isolate malicious script (Completed)
   - ✅ Implement correct deployment script (Completed)
   - Review system logs for any execution attempts
   - Review server access logs

2. **Security Improvements**
   - Implement file integrity monitoring
   - Regular audit of deployment scripts
   - Restrict sudo access
   - Implement change management procedures
   - Regular security audits of deployment processes

3. **Process Changes**
   - All deployment scripts must be reviewed before implementation
   - Deployment scripts should be stored in version control
   - Regular backups of critical system files
   - Implementation of deployment script signatures

### Prevention Measures

1. **Access Control**
   - Restrict sudo access to authorized personnel only
   - Implement proper file permissions
   - Use version control for all deployment scripts

2. **Monitoring**
   - Implement file integrity monitoring
   - Regular security audits
   - Log monitoring for suspicious activities

3. **Training**
   - Staff training on security best practices
   - Code review procedures
   - Deployment process documentation

### Log Analysis

Analysis of `/home/linuxuser/deploy.log` revealed:
- Multiple attempts were made to execute the malicious script
- All execution attempts failed due to syntax errors
- No successful execution of the destructive commands occurred
- Log entries show syntax errors from the malformed if condition
- The script's own obfuscation likely prevented its successful execution

This indicates that while there was malicious intent, the attack was unsuccessful due to:
1. Syntax errors in the malicious code
2. The script's self-obfuscation preventing execution
3. System safeguards requiring proper script syntax

### Additional Notes

The legitimate deployment script is located at `/home/linuxuser/scripts/quicksummit-deploy.sh` and contains proper safety checks and path validations. All future deployments should use this verified script only.
